## 📘 Project Overview

This repository contains the practical work developed for the **Numerical Methods** course.  
The project focuses on applying and comparing different numerical techniques using **Julia**, emphasizing:

- Mathematical formulation of each method  
- Implementation from scratch  
- Numerical stability and approximation quality  
- Visualization of results  

A written report explaining the theory, methodology, and conclusions is also included.

## 🔢 Numerical Methods Implemented

### 📌 Interpolation and Approximation
- **Barycentric interpolation**
- **Chebyshev polynomial interpolation**
- **Hermite interpolation**
- **Spline interpolation**

Each method is implemented independently and tested on representative datasets to analyze accuracy and behavior.

---

### 🎯 Applied Simulation
- **Particle motion simulation**, visualized through animations (`.gif`)
- Study of numerical behavior over time

---

## 🧠 Key Learning Outcomes

- Practical understanding of classical numerical methods
- Comparison between different interpolation strategies
- Awareness of numerical error, stability, and convergence
- Use of Julia for scientific computing and visualization
